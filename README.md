# Mat Studio

A visual CSS styling tool that lets you create reusable style "mats" and apply them to HTML elements through drag-and-drop. Build beautiful interfaces faster with an intuitive, code-free approach to styling.

## Features

- **Style Cards (Mats)**: Create named style collections with multiple CSS properties
- **Smart Property Picker**: Browse 90+ CSS properties organized by category (Typography, Layout, Flexbox, Grid, etc.)
- **Value Suggestions**: Get intelligent value recommendations for each CSS property
- **Live Preview**: See changes instantly in an interactive iframe preview
- **Drag & Drop**: Simply drag mats onto any element to apply styles
- **Element Inspector**: Click elements to view and remove applied mats
- **HTML Editor**: Edit your HTML directly with real-time preview updates
- **Export**: Download complete HTML with all applied styles

## How It Works

1. Create a mat and add CSS properties using the smart pickers
2. Drag the mat card onto any element in the preview
3. Multiple mats can stack on the same element
4. Click elements to inspect and manage applied styles
5. Export your styled HTML when done
